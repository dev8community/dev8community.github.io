    <p>In Region 8, where many young developers feel pressured to seek opportunities elsewhere, two homegrown tech ventures are proving that meaningful work can begin right at home. Both Cerena Solutions and areglaw.ai were founded by developer Faith Cerena, each born from different moments but shaped by the same intention: to make work more manageable for the people in her life, from aspiring developers in Eastern Visayas to her own sister navigating the demands of law school.</p>
    <p>Cerena Solutions officially started on October 26, 2023. Faith brought together a small team of three developers whose skills had already earned the trust of offshore clients. Encouraged by that confidence, they formalized their work into a company with a clear goal of delivering reliable, future-proof solutions while creating opportunities for local tech talent in Tacloban and across Eastern Visayas.</p>
    <p>The early days were messy in the way only most startups can be—figuring out roles, building internal processes, and keeping up with client work all at once. Over time, the mission expanded. Cerena Solutions remained committed to uplifting local graduates, but it also set its sights on becoming the leading MuleSoft provider. Two years in, the company has grown into a Salesforce partner with a team of fifteen, defining success as both client impact and the opportunities it creates for homegrown developers.</p>
    <p>Areglaw.ai began from a far more personal place. Faith's sister, a second-year law student, called her one night in tears, overwhelmed by nonstop legal research. Faith responded the only way she knew how: she built something to help. What started as a quiet promise turned into areglaw.ai, launched on July 1, 2025. Within three weeks, it reached over 2,000 users—law students and practitioners seeking a faster, smarter way to navigate legal research.</p>
    <p>Both companies carry simple messages. From Cerena Solutions: take risks and trust yourself. From areglaw.ai: technology should support people, not replace them. Together, they show how innovation can grow from care, community, and the decision to build solutions where they matter most.</p>
