        <h1>Dev8 Event Code of Conduct</h1>
        <p class="date">January 12, 2024</p>
        <p class="tldr">TLDR: Don't be rude.</p>

        <p>
            This Code of Conduct outlines the expected behavior of all attendees, speakers, sponsors, volunteers, and staff at Dev8 events, both online and in-person. It is designed to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of background, identity, or experience.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Pledge</h2>
        <p>Dev8 is committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We expect all participants to treat each other with respect and consideration, creating a space where everyone feels safe and valued.</p>

        <h2>Expected Behaviour</h2>
        <p>All participants at Dev8 events are expected to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Be respectful and considerate.</strong> Treat everyone with courtesy and respect, regardless of their background, identity, or experience. We encourage friendly and safe interactions with one another to facilitate healthy discussions and relationships and provide a welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of sex, race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, gender, socio-economic class, religion, and mental and physical ability.</li>
            <li><strong>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, and harassing behavior and speech.</strong> Everyone is expected to be kind to each other. Violent threats or language directed against another participant, discriminatory jokes and language, personal insults (especially in racist and sexist forms), demeaning of participants with mental or physical health problems, unwelcome sexual attention, encouraging the aforementioned behavior, and general harassment are prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Communicate openly and thoughtfully.</strong> Use respectful language and avoid personal attacks. Be mindful of the impact your words and actions may have on others.</li>
            <li><strong>Be inclusive.</strong> Actively work to create a welcoming environment for all participants. Be mindful of different communication styles and cultural backgrounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect event spaces.</strong> Maintain the cleanliness and order of event venues, both physical and virtual. Follow any instructions provided by event staff.</li>
            <li><strong>Adhere to venue rules.</strong> Respect the rules and regulations of any venue hosting a Dev8 event.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Unacceptable Behaviour</h2>
        <p>The following behaviors are considered unacceptable at Dev8 events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Harassment.</strong> This includes any form of verbal, written, or physical harassment, intimidation, or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, religion, or other protected characteristics.</li>
            <li><strong>Discriminatory or offensive language.</strong> Using slurs, derogatory comments, or other offensive language is strictly prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Unwelcome sexual attention.</strong> This includes unwanted advances, inappropriate touching, and sexualized comments or jokes.</li>
            <li><strong>Stalking or following.</strong> Any behavior that makes someone feel unsafe or uncomfortable is unacceptable.</li>
            <li><strong>Disruptive behavior.</strong> Any behavior that disrupts the flow of the event or interferes with the enjoyment of other participants. This includes excessive noise, heckling, and public intoxication and disruption of any technology equipment including hacking, and spamming messages.</li>
            <li><strong>Distribution of inappropriate materials.</strong> Sharing or displaying sexually suggestive, discriminatory, or offensive content is prohibited.</li>
            <li><strong>Violation of venue rules.</strong> Any behavior that violates the rules and regulations of the event venue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>
        <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, Dev8 event organizers may take any action they deem appropriate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All violations shall be dealt with punishments proportional to the severity of the violations. Punishments will be determined by the event organizers. The punishment for any violations may be a ban from the event and/or future Dev8 events.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Light violations</strong>, resulting from unintentional or accidental detraction from the Expected Behavior, will not immediately result in punishments. The offending party shall be given a warning by the event organizers or designated staff member and be given a reasonable time to perform corrective actions. Failure to correct or perform another violation within the provided time window shall result in the application of a punishment.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Severe violations</strong>, resulting from intentional detraction from Expected Behavior, will result in immediate bans from the event and/or future Dev8 events. The duration of the ban will be determined by the event organizers and will be based on the severity of the violation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The offender may appeal against their punishment should they see that the punishment is unjust, which may result in the punishment being lifted or lessened.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In cases of serious violations, Dev8 may report the incident to law enforcement.</p>
        
        <h2>Reporting Violations</h2>
        <p>If you experience or witness any violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to a Dev8 event organizer or designated staff member. You can do this in person or via email (see <em>Contact Information</em>). All reports will be treated confidentially.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When reporting an incident, please provide as much detail as possible, including:</p>
