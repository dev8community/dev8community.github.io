        <li>[February 9, 2024] In <a href="developer-profile" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Profile</a>, we initial published the wrong percentage values for the "College Alma Mater" and "Degree Programme" sections. The percentages displayed now should be the correct values already.</li>
        <li>[February 9, 2024] The second <a href="#full-stack-dev-highlight">highlight</a> was written as "Most developers consider themselves to be a full stack developer." instead of "Most developers consider themselves to be full stack developers.". This has been fixed.</li>
        <li>[February 9, 2024] The text in "Event Locations" in <a href="miscellaneous" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miscellaneous</a> had some writing issues. We updated it to improve its writing.</li>
        <li>[February 10, 2024] The Primary Languages section in <a href="technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technologies</a> had the wrong percentage values for the "Professionals/Freelancers" and "Students and Unemployed" demographics. This issue has been rectified.</li>
        <li>[February 10, 2024] The "View More Technologies Results" button in <a href="technologies" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technologies</a> used "View More Technology Results". We corrected this to use the correct section title text.</li>
    </ul>
