        <li>[February 9, 2024] In <a href="developer-profile" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developer Profile</a>, we initial published the wrong percentage values for the "College Alma Mater" and "Degree Programme" sections. The percentages displayed now should be the correct values already.</li>
        <li>[February 9, 2024] The second <a href="#full-stack-dev-highlight">highlight</a> was written as "Most developers consider themselves to be a full stack developer." instead of "Most developers consider themselves to be full stack developers.". This has been fixed.</li>
