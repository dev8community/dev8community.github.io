    <h1>Thank You!</h1>
    <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hey, there! Thank you for taking the time to check the results of our tech scene survey for 2023. We'd also like to say thank you to all our respondents. Without them, this survey wouldn't have been made it. We did our best to compile all the results and present them in a digestable manner. We cannot present all possible insights that we can obtain. So, feel free to play around with the raw survey data we are providing as well. You may stumble upon insights we havenâ€™t seen. If you find any mistakes or have any comments, you may contact us via <a href="mailto:dev8community@gmail.com">email</a> or our <a href="https://facebook.com/dev8community">Facebook Page</a>. We're planning to do this again for 2024, and we'll do our best to make the next surveys better. We hope to get more respondents too next time.</p>
