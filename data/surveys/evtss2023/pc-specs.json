    "description": "Most developers in Eastern Visayas who use PCs reported that they sport a mid-range CPU, though many students also have entry-level CPUs. Most of them also sport an integrated GPU. In terms of memory, most developers report that they have at least 16 GB of RAM. Storage-wise, SSDs with at least 512 GB of storage are the most popular.",
