    "text": "In the survey, we added smartphones among the options for the computer being used most of the time by respondents. There was only <strong>one</strong> respondent who selected smartphones. This very same person reported that they use a model of smartphones that were not among the choices in the survey. Due to the minimal number of respondents that selected tablets and smartphones as their primary computer, we are not displaying a graph."
