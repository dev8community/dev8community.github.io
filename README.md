# dev8community.github.io
Website for Dev8.

## Development
### Prerequisites 
Before you can work on the website, you must install [Knitter](https://github.com/dev8community/knitter) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/), which must be callable with `sass`.

### Running a Server
To run a server for the website so that you can see changes, simply run:

```bash
$ knitter serve
```

### Building the Website
To build the website, simply run:

```bash
$ knitter build
```

The distributable will be in a `dist/` folder in the same folder.

### Technologies
We use SCSS for our CSS files, JSON for our data files, and Jinja2 for our HTML templates. Of course, we use HTML.

### Configuration
Configuration for things like routes and processed files are specified in `knitter.toml`. Please refer to the documentation of [Knitter](https://github.com/dev8community/knitter) for details on `knitter.toml`.
